You gotta savor the ending of a good book. When you know it's the last page or paragraph you can slow down and really feel what the characters are feeling. With audiobooks and ebooks, though, it's harder to savor? The audiobook narrator's job is to keep things steady, not to slow down or overly imbue with emotion. When I read _Unlikely Animals_ via audiobook, I feel like I ran into that problem. Where the ending didn't leave me feeling anything. In that moment I felt like it was because I wasn't ready for it to end. I wasn't listening for the wrap up and I wasn't picking up however the author wanted me to feel: the point they were making. I've felt it with ebooks too, sometimes, where I'm reading fast and turning pages, just to realize that this sentence was actually the last one.

Books are about the ideas they inspire and the emotions they make you feel, and with fiction savoring the ending is often a big part of that.
