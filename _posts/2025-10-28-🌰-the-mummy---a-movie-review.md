Note: This review makes it easy to avoid spoilers.

**Watch this movie if** you're looking for a light-hearted, well-constructed adventure movie with fun characters and fantasy elements.

**Skip for now if** you're looking for deeper commentary on racism and the colonialist approach of historical archeology.

I can see why Tumblr is obsessed with this movie. It's a fun, well-constructed adventure fantasy with fun characters, a tight plot, good visuals, and strong acting. All action movies should use this as a model, there's nothing sloppy about its construction.

# What Worked
- The main characters are all great fun. This genre isn't one that requires complex characters, but The Mummy straddles the line well: the characters suit the genre while remaining well-rounded and interesting.
- fun, great main characters, great (meaning fun/artistic) use of CGI & effects hold up, well-written, Evy actually does stuff

# What Didn't
While it criticizes how white people treat the locals as disposable & kinda critiques looting, it falls into the same traps itself:
- The one Egyptian member of the protagonist party is the butt of jokes & the protagonists make fun of him.
- <details><summary>spoiler</summary>It didn't make sense for Evy's boss to sacrifice himself.</details>


# Other Thoughts
- Interesting how at the beginning of the movie, you're sympathetic to the mummy. But the rest of the characters never understand that. 
	- <details><summary>spoiler</summary>Low-key I was thinking they could have made him mortal and sacrificed Benny to bring the girlfriend back lol. I think if the movie were made today, that's how it would have gone. Benny "accidentally" gets sacrificed.</details>
	- And maybe that's a worse/flatter movie, in the end? It would suggest that the ends justify the means/that the world always works out "just right".
