There's a throwaway sentence in [🌱 Flow is betting that the best way to succeed as a crypto company is to build like they are not a crypto company]({% post_url 2021-06-23-🌱-flow-is-betting-that-the-best-way-to-succeed-as-a-crypto-company-is-to-build-like-they-are-not-a-crypto-company %}):
> Most crypto projects are "public" from day 1. From the day they have a token launch, they're a public company with investors that expect returns.

It's an under-discussed consequence of blockchain. When you launch a governance token, you are going public. And what does it mean to go public when 50% of your investors are also 100% of your user base? Mixed incentives.

[Steem.it](https://steemit.com/trending) and [Medium](https://medium.com/) are good examples of the impact of these mixed incentives. Both are platforms where the eyeballs and clicks your work gets dictates if, and how much, you get paid. Cue short, vacuous click-bait on Medium. Cue short, robot-upvoted confusing posts on Steemit.[^steemit] The fact that Steemit runs on _three_ different tokens speaks to how difficult it is to pay-per-click _and_ create a good product.

[^steemit]: It's worth noting that I've not gone on Medium or Steemit in years due to these issues. It's hard to tell how much better Steemit has gotten as the majority of their posts are not in English. But I feel my point remains. Let me know if I'm missing something.

Another great way to glean the impact of going public so early is to look at product forums. I recently came across [Yup.io](yup.io), a global bookmarking system, where if other people follow your bookmarks, you get paid. They [currently have](https://yupprotocol.org/) 18k users, 142k bookmarks, and have paid out $550k in rewards. They also have a Yup token, which basically means Yup has gone public at 18k users.

[Here's what users are talking about on the forums](https://forum.yup.io/t/discovering-new-use-cases-for-yup/36):
> This is the concern I've found related to YUP token. Apparently it does not have much of use case other than staking and maintaining influence. But these two are not enough to sustain healthy price and market for YUP token.
> My proposal is to give YUP a use case by collaboration with NFT platforms to buy/sell NFTs in YUP, creating merchandise store, etc. which will eventually create demand for YUP.
> Any other ideas to provide YUP a new use case, comment it down.

Is that what you want your users and your board[^board] focused on at such an early stage? I doubt it. It makes me wonder if [🌳 Flow]({% post_url 2021-03-21-🌳-flow %}) is right in locking down who can buy their tokens for now.

[^board]: After all, launching a governance token basically means you've gone public and made your user base your board.
